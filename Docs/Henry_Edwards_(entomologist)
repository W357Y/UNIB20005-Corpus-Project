<p><b>Henry Edwards</b> (August 27, 1827 – June 9, 1891), known as "Harry", was an <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">English-born</a> stage actor, writer and <a href="/wiki/Entomology" title="Entomology">entomologist</a> who gained fame in Australia, <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> and <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> for his theater work.</p>
<p>Edwards was drawn to the theater early in life, and he appeared in amateur productions in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>. After sailing to Australia, Edwards appeared professionally in <a href="/wiki/William_Shakespeare" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespearean</a> plays and light comedies primarily in <a href="/wiki/Melbourne" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> and Sydney. Throughout his childhood in England and his acting career in Australia, he was greatly interested in <a href="/wiki/Insect_collecting" title="Insect collecting">collecting insects</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Museum_Victoria" title="Museum Victoria">National Museum of Victoria</a> used the results of his Australian fieldwork as part of the genesis of their collection.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, Edwards was a founding member of the <a href="/wiki/Bohemian_Club" title="Bohemian Club">Bohemian Club</a>, and a gathering in Edwards' honor was the spark which began the club's traditional summer encampment at the <a href="/wiki/Bohemian_Grove" title="Bohemian Grove">Bohemian Grove</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Garnett7_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Garnett7-2"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> As well, Edwards cemented his reputation as a preeminent stage actor and theater manager. After writing a series of influential studies on <a href="/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="West Coast of the United States">Pacific Coast</a> butterflies and moths he was elected life member of the <a href="/wiki/California_Academy_of_Sciences" title="California Academy of Sciences">California Academy of Sciences</a>. Relocating eastward, a brief time spent in <a href="/wiki/Boston" title="Boston">Boston</a> theater led to a connection to <a href="/wiki/Wallack%27s_Theatre" title="Wallack's Theatre">Wallack's Theatre</a> and further renown in New York City. There, Edwards edited three volumes of the journal <i>Papilio</i> and published a major work about the life of the butterfly.<sup id="cite_ref-Beutenmuller_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Beutenmuller-1"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> His large collection of insect specimens served as the foundation of the <a href="/wiki/American_Museum_of_Natural_History" title="American Museum of Natural History">American Museum of Natural History</a>'s butterfly and moth studies.</p>
<p>Edwards' wide-ranging studies and observations of insects brought him into contact with specimens not yet classified. Upon discovering previously unknown insects he would give them names, which led to a number of <a href="/wiki/Butterfly" title="Butterfly">butterfly</a>, <a href="/wiki/Moth" title="Moth">moth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Beetle" title="Beetle">beetle</a> species bearing "Hy. Edw." (for Henry Edwards) as an attribution.<sup id="cite_ref-Lepidopterists_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lepidopterists-3"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> From his theater interests to entomology, Edwards carried forward an appreciation of Shakespeare—in the designation of new insect species he favored female character names from Shakespeare's plays.</p>

<p>Henry Edwards was born to Hannah and Thomas Edwards (c. 1794–1857) at Brook House in <a href="/wiki/Ross-on-Wye" title="Ross-on-Wye">Ross-on-Wye</a>, <a href="/wiki/Herefordshire" title="Herefordshire">Herefordshire</a>, England, on August 27, 1827, and was christened on September 14.<sup id="cite_ref-Brown-May_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Brown-May-4"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> From his older brother William, he picked up an interest in examining insects. He collected butterflies as a hobby, and studied them under the tutelage of <a href="/wiki/Edward_Doubleday" title="Edward Doubleday">Edward Doubleday</a>. His <a href="/wiki/Solicitor" title="Solicitor">solicitor</a> father intended a law career for his son, but after a brief period of unsuccessful study, Edwards took a position at a <a href="/wiki/Counting_house" title="Counting house">counting house</a> in London, and began acting in amateur theater. He then journeyed to join his brother William who had settled in Australia, nine miles (14&#160;km) north-west of <a href="/wiki/Melbourne" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> along the bank of <a href="/wiki/Merri_Creek" title="Merri Creek">Merri Creek</a>, a location then called Merrivale. Aboard the sailing ship <i>Ganges</i> from March to June 1853, he wrote descriptions of creatures such as the <a href="/wiki/Albatross" title="Albatross">albatross</a> that he encountered for the first time.<sup id="cite_ref-Brown-May_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Brown-May-4"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> After arriving in Melbourne, Edwards began collecting and cataloging the insects he found on his brother's land, and further afield. Within two years, he had gathered 1,676 species of insects, shot and mounted 200 birds, and pressed some 200 botanical specimens.<sup id="cite_ref-Brown-May_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Brown-May-4"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> This collection and that of William Kershaw were purchased by <a href="/wiki/Frederick_McCoy" title="Frederick McCoy">Frederick McCoy</a> to form the nucleus of the new <a href="/wiki/Museum_Victoria" title="Museum Victoria">National Museum of Victoria</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Brown-May_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Brown-May-4"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The first Australian stage appearance by Edwards was with <a href="/wiki/George_Selth_Coppin" title="George Selth Coppin">George Selth Coppin</a>'s company at the Queen's Theatre in Melbourne. Later, he joined <a href="/wiki/Gustavus_Vaughan_Brooke" title="Gustavus Vaughan Brooke">Gustavus Vaughan Brooke</a>'s theatrical group. The part of <a href="/wiki/Petruchio" title="Petruchio">Petruchio</a>, the male lead in Shakespeare's <i><a href="/wiki/The_Taming_of_the_Shrew" title="The Taming of the Shrew">The Taming of the Shrew</a></i>, was filled by Edwards at the Princess's Theatre in Sydney in November, 1859, playing opposite <a href="/wiki/Tragedy" title="Tragedy">tragedian</a> Avonia Jones as Katharine.<sup id="cite_ref-Brooke_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Brooke-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> In December that year Brooke retired from management, yielding the reins of his company to the team of Edwards and George Fawcett Rowe, English actor and playwright. Brooke continued to act under Edwards and Rowe: his starring performance in April 1860 as <a href="/wiki/Louis_XI_of_France" title="Louis XI of France">Louis XI</a> in <a href="/wiki/Dion_Boucicault" title="Dion Boucicault">Dion Boucicault</a>'s play of the same name was a stirring portrayal that Edwards, playing <a href="/wiki/Jacques_d%27Armagnac,_Duke_of_Nemours" title="Jacques d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours">Jacques d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours</a>, recalled vividly for the rest of his life.<sup id="cite_ref-Brooke_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Brooke-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Sharing the stage again in August, Brooke and Edwards were well received in their portrayal of twin brothers in a production of Shakespeare's <i><a href="/wiki/The_Comedy_of_Errors" title="The Comedy of Errors">The Comedy of Errors</a></i> in Melbourne, the first Australian mounting of that work.<sup id="cite_ref-Brooke_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Brooke-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> As a twist to pique public interest, Edwards and Brooke exchanged roles after two weeks' run. However, not all of Edwards' performances were successful: his turn at <a href="/wiki/Angelo_(Measure_for_Measure)" title="Angelo (Measure for Measure)">Angelo</a> in Shakespeare's <i><a href="/wiki/Measure_for_Measure" title="Measure for Measure">Measure for Measure</a></i> was called "invertebrate"<sup id="cite_ref-Brooke_5-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Brooke-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> by drama critic William John Lawrence; in Lawrence's estimation, Edwards and his fellow actors paled against the powerful performance of Avonia Jones as Isabella.<sup id="cite_ref-Brooke_5-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Brooke-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The renowned entomologist and collector <a href="/wiki/William_Sharp_Macleay" title="William Sharp Macleay">William Sharp Macleay</a> was sought out by Edwards whenever his stage appearances took him to Sydney. Beginning in 1858, Macleay mentored Edwards and encouraged him to search for more insect specimens when his theater obligations allowed. Robust and adventuresome, Edwards occasionally trekked out into the wilds of Australia on the hunt for insects. While in Sydney, Edwards went up two times in a <a href="/wiki/Hot_air_balloon" title="Hot air balloon">hot air balloon</a> as a favor to George Coppin, narrowly avoiding severe injury or death in the first ascent.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Edwards' further travels included New Zealand,<sup id="cite_ref-Royal_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Royal-7"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Peru, Panama and Mexico in pursuit of insects and dramatic roles.<sup id="cite_ref-Lepidopterists_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lepidopterists-3"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In 1865, Edwards began a 12-year residence in San Francisco, <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>. At the <a href="/wiki/1870_United_States_Census" title="1870 United States Census">1870 United States Census</a>, Edwards reported himself as a non-voting foreign-born resident, a <a href="/wiki/Comedy_(drama)" title="Comedy (drama)">comedian</a> by trade, living in a home worth $1,000.<sup id="cite_ref-1870Census_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1870Census-8"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Edwards lived in San Francisco with a white woman listed in the census as "Mariana", born in England, age 40, and a 16-year-old Chinese servant named Heng Gim.<sup id="cite_ref-1870Census_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1870Census-8"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> The woman Mariana was likely Edwards's wife,<sup id="cite_ref-nyt_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nyt-9"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> the former Marianne Elizabeth Woolcott Bray who was born about 1822–1823 in <a href="/wiki/New_Street,_Birmingham" title="New Street, Birmingham">New Street, Birmingham</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Brooke_5-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Brooke-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1851 at the age of 28, Bray married Gustavus Vaughan Brooke, and the two went to Australia to manage Brooke's then-new theater company. It was there that Edwards met Brooke and his wife, but after several years of the two men working together, Brooke remarried in February 1863, taking Avonia Jones (1836–1867)<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> as his second wife.

Edwards in New York</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>From Boston, Edwards moved to New York to stay for some ten years, performing on stage and participating in insect studies. He was active in the Brooklyn and New York Entomological Societies. In 1881, he co-founded and edited a butterfly enthusiast's periodical entitled <i>Papilio</i>, named for the <a href="/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a> <i>Papilio</i> in the <a href="/wiki/Swallowtail_butterfly" title="Swallowtail butterfly">swallowtail butterfly</a> <a href="/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a>, <a href="/wiki/Swallowtail_butterfly" title="Swallowtail butterfly">Papilionidae</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Lepidopterists_3-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lepidopterists-3"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> Edwards served as editor until January 1884 when he gave the reins to his friend Eugene Murray-Aaron of Philadelphia.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> <i>Papilio</i> was published until 1885 when its subscription base was merged into the more general <i>Entomologia Americana</i>, published by the Brooklyn Entomological Society.</p>
<p>Beginning in December 1880 under <a href="/wiki/John_Lester_Wallack" title="John Lester Wallack">Lester Wallack</a>, the charismatic son of the theater's founder, Edwards was associated with <a href="/wiki/Wallack%27s_Theatre" title="Wallack's Theatre">Wallack's Theatre</a> in New York, called the "finest theatre company in America".<sup id="cite_ref-Hardee47_27-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hardee47-27"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> Now in his 50s, the entomologist and actor appeared in such representative British dramatic roles as Prince Malleotti in <i>Forget Me Not</i>, Max Harkaway in <i><a href="/wiki/London_Assurance" title="London Assurance">London Assurance</a></i>, Baron Stein in <i>Diplomacy</i>, and Master Walter in <i>The Hunchback</i>, reprising <a href="/wiki/James_Sheridan_Knowles" title="James Sheridan Knowles">James Sheridan Knowles</a>' earlier portrayal. Edwards used Wallack's Theatre as his professional mailing address, and helped manage it upon occasion. Wallack, already head "Shepherd" of the <a href="/wiki/Lambs_Club" title="Lambs Club" class="mw-redirect">Lambs Club</a>, a modest meetinghouse of professional stage actors, invited Edwards to join.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> Once a Lamb, Edwards threw his energies in with those of Wallack and other club members to aid newspaper editor <a href="/wiki/Harrison_Grey_Fiske" title="Harrison Grey Fiske">Harrison Grey Fiske</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Charitable_organization" title="Charitable organization">organization of a charitable fund</a> to support destitute actors or their widows.

A year after its first meeting on July 15, 1882 at Wallack's Theatre, Edwards was made secretary, a position he held for one year.

<p>Gathering together under one cover his various short subjects, essays, and elegies to fallen friends, Edwards published in 1883 a wryly humorous book entitled <i>A Mingled Yarn</i>, including tales of travels and stories of his time in the Bohemian Club. Dedicated to the Bohemians, "with grateful memories, and feelings of affectionate regard,"<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> the book was favorably reviewed in the <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Tribune" title="New York Tribune">New York Tribune</a></i>.
